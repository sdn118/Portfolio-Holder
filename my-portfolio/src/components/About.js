        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Sheree Nicholson. Well what to say about myself, I have only been coding for little over a half a year now. Honestly it was something I never expected  to get into, but I am so glad I did. I enjoy so much to design websites and learning how websites and apps actually work in our everyday lives. I am a hardworking indiviual who is hoping to one day make this into an enjoyable career. Please take your time to look over my Resume and portfolio. And thank you for your time!</p>
